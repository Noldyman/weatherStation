# weatherStation
First Arduino project: simple weather station.

liquidCrystal and DHTLib were used.

Following LCD pins were connected to arduino: {RS: 12, E: 11, D4: 5, D5: 4, D6: 3, D7: 2}. 2K ohm resistor was used for LCD contrast (V0) and  330 ohm resistor was used for LCD backlight (A)

Signal of DHT11 temp/hum sensor was was connected to pin 7
